#### [Proposing Alertawy](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFlcxArrF4/8AGAj3IOSuUBNd198ntrQw/view?utm_content=DAFlcxArrF4&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink), Your ultimate driving safety companion. Revolutionizing driver safety through AI-Powered monitoring system.


# **Abstract**

Road accidents caused by drowsy and distracted driving pose a significant threat, leading to a high number of fatalities and devastating consequences for families. In response, this project presents Alertawy, an integrated AI-Powered monitor system comprising a mobile application and a web application. The mobile application leverages the power of AI to detect driver distractions, drowsiness, and lack of focus on the road. It provides timely alerts to drivers who are using their phones, experiencing drowsiness, or displaying signs of distraction. Additionally, Alertawy assists drivers in evading radar detection and exceeding speed limits. Using computer vision techniques and deep learning models, the system predicts the driver's current state, ensuring privacy by performing all inferences on the device itself.

The web application serves as an administration platform, enabling transportation companies to effectively monitor driver reports and evaluate their performance. By analyzing detailed ride data and generating insightful reports, the web application empowers companies to proactively address potential issues and ensure a higher level of driver safety. The project aims to provide proof of concept for an AI-Powered Driver Monitoring System, with the overarching objective of reducing daily accidents caused by driver inattentiveness, drowsiness, or distractions. By monitoring and analyzing the drivers' states while they are on the road, Alertawy contributes to the creation of safer driving environments for all.

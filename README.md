# Alertawy Web Application
### Administrators Web Interface.

# Abstract

Similar to our mobile application, we utilized the Flutter framework for the development of our web application to maintain consistency across our system components. Firebase Firestore was employed as the database solution, enabling cloud-based storage and seamless integration with our mobile app. To provide map monitoring functionality, we integrated Google Maps API into our web application, leveraging its smooth integration capabilities with our system components.

Our administration web application follows the same principles and technologies as our mobile application. Built using the Flutter framework for web development, it benefits from the platform's extensive features and advantages in creating clean and well-organized code architectures while adhering to design patterns.

Just like in our mobile app, we have placed significant emphasis on adhering to SOLID Principles, ensuring that our code is maintainable, scalable, and follows best practices. Additionally, we have implemented the Singleton Design Pattern for our Authentication Service, which helps in managing admin and company roles authentication efficiently.

Moreover, we have chosen to adopt the MVC pattern for handling interactions with Cloud Firestore and managing various operations within our web app. This pattern provides a clear separation of concerns, with models responsible for mapping data from Firestore's JSON documents, controllers handling data manipulation and retrieval, and views rendering the user interface with data obtained through controllers.

By employing these design patterns and leveraging Flutter's capabilities for web development, our administration web application achieves a well-structured and robust foundation, ensuring a smooth user experience and facilitating easy maintenance and future enhancements.

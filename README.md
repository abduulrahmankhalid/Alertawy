# Alertawy Web Application
### Administrators Web Interface.

# Abstract

Similar to our mobile application, we utilized the Flutter framework for the development of our web application to maintain consistency across our system components. Firebase Firestore was employed as the database solution, enabling cloud-based storage and seamless integration with our mobile app. To provide map monitoring functionality, we integrated Google Maps API into our web application, leveraging its smooth integration capabilities with our system components.

Our administration web application is built using Flutter, following the same principles and technologies as our mobile application. We prioritize adherence to SOLID Principles, ensuring maintainable and scalable code. The Singleton Design Pattern is implemented for efficient admin and company roles authentication. With the MVC pattern, we handle interactions with Cloud Firestore, separating concerns and enabling smooth data manipulation, retrieval, and UI rendering. These design patterns, combined with Flutter's web development capabilities, provide a solid foundation for a well-structured and user-friendly application. Additionally, we host the web app on Firebase Hosting, leveraging its scalability and security for a reliable user experience.

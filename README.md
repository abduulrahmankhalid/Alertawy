# Alertawy Mobile Application
### Drivers Mobile Application.

# Abstract
For the development of our mobile application, we chose the Flutter framework due to its user-friendly nature, easy learning curve, and seamless integration with our system components. Firebase Firestore was selected as our database solution, benefiting from its cloud-based architecture and compatibility with our web application. Leveraging Google Maps API, we incorporated map monitoring functionality into our mobile application, as it offers smooth integration with our system components and serves as the best free option for a maps API with strong support in the Flutter framework.

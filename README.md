# Alertawy Web Application
### Administrators Web Interface.

# Abstract

Similar to our mobile application, we utilized the Flutter framework for the development of our web application to maintain consistency across our system components. Firebase Firestore was employed as the database solution, enabling cloud-based storage and seamless integration with our mobile app. To provide map monitoring functionality, we integrated Google Maps API into our web application, leveraging its smooth integration capabilities with our system components.
